    "Machine learning is often categorized as a subfield of artificial intelligence, but I find that categorization can be misleading.\n",
    "The study of machine learning certainly arose from research in this context, but in the data science application of machine learning methods, it's more helpful to think of machine learning as a means of *building models of data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, \"learning\" enters the fray when we give these models *tunable parameters* that can be adapted to observed data; in this way the program can be considered to be \"learning\" from the data.\n",
    "Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data.\n",
    "I'll leave to the reader the more philosophical digression regarding the extent to which this type of mathematical, model-based \"learning\" is similar to the \"learning\" exhibited by the human brain.\n",

    "## Categories of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised learning* involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some labels associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data.\n",
    "This is sometimes further subdivided into classification tasks and regression tasks: in *classification*, the labels are discrete categories, while in *regression*, the labels are continuous quantities.\n",
    "You will see examples of both types of supervised learning in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unsupervised learning* involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label.\n",
    "These models include tasks such as *clustering* and *dimensionality reduction.*\n",
    "Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.\n",
    "You will also see examples of both types of unsupervised learning in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are so-called *semi-supervised learning* methods, which fall somewhere between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning methods are often useful when only incomplete labels are available."
