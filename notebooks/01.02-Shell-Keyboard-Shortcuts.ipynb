    "If you spend any amount of time on a computer, you've probably found a use for keyboard shortcuts in your workflow.\n",
    "Most familiar perhaps are Cmd-c and Cmd-v (or Ctrl-c and Ctrl-v), used for copying and pasting in a wide variety of programs and systems.\n",
    "Power users tend to go even further: popular text editors like Emacs, Vim, and others provide users an incredible range of operations through intricate combinations of keystrokes.\n",

    "The IPython shell doesn't go this far, but does provide a number of keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation while typing commands.\n",
    "While some of these shortcuts do work in the browser-based notebooks, this section is primarily about shortcuts in the IPython shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get accustomed to these, they can be very useful for quickly performing certain commands without moving your hands from the \"home\" keyboard position.\n",
    "If you're an Emacs user or if you have experience with Linux-style shells, the following will be very familiar.\n",
