See also the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).


## Code Listings

All the code from the book can be found in [code_listings](code_listings).
The code is in IPython notebooks, organized by book chapter and section.


## Figure Appendix

Nearly every figure used in the book was generated using Matplotlib.
Most figures are generated by the code within the text; those few that are not
can be found in the online-only [Figure Appendix](figure_appendix/06.00-Figure-Code.ipynb)


## Full Notebooks

The full notebooks, containing the entire text of the book, will be posted here as soon as the copy-edit process is finished. Stay tuned!
